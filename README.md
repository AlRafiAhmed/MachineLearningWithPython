## Getting Started

### Prerequisites Installation

1. **Python Installation**
   ```bash
   # Check if Python is installed
   python --version
   # Should show Python 3.x
   ```
   If not installed:
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Windows: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   - macOS: `brew install python3`
   - Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3`

2. **Git Installation**
   ```bash
   # Check if Git is installed
   git --version
   ```
   If not installed:
   - Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - macOS: `brew install git`
   - Linux: `sudo apt-get install git`

### Project Setup

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [repository-url]
   
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd MachineLearningWithPython
   ```

2. **Virtual Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate virtual environment
   # Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Verify activation (should show virtual environment path)
   which python
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Upgrade pip
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip

   # Core packages
   pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib

   # Machine Learning packages
   pip install scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost

   # Install all requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Verify installations
   pip list
   ```

### Jupyter Setup

1. **Start Jupyter**
   ```bash
   # Start Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook

   # Or for JupyterLab
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Browser Access**
   - Jupyter will open in your default browser
   - Default URL: http://localhost:8888
   - Navigate to `Sessions/Day1` to begin

### Directory Structure
- Each session is organized in separate folders
- Follow the notebooks in numerical order
- Complete exercises at the end of each notebook

### Best Practices
- Create a separate branch for your work
- Keep the virtual environment active while working
- Save your work frequently
- Complete all exercises before moving to next session

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
2. Verify all packages are installed correctly
3. Check Python version compatibility
4. Consult the issues section in the repository
